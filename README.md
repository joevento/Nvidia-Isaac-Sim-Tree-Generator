# Nvidia Isaac Sim Tree Generator

This script is designed to generate a forest of trees in an NVIDIA Isaac Sim simulation based on information provided in a `.txt` file. Each line in the `.txt` file represents the coordinates, type, and scale of a tree to be placed in the simulation.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Make sure you have NVIDIA Isaac Sim installed and set up.

2. **Download Tree Models**: Download tree models in USD format and specify their paths in the script. I sadly cannot share the trees I used when developing this. So you will have to find or model them yourself.
   (`Birch_usd_path`, `Spruce_usd_path`, `Pine_usd_path`, `Maple_usd_path`).

4. **Prepare Tree Coordinates File**: Create a `.txt` file containing tree coordinates, type, and scale information. Each line in the file should be formatted as follows:
   ```
   x_coordinate; y_coordinate; z_coordinate; tree_type; scale_x; scale_y; scale_z
   ```

5. **Run the Script**: Run the script and specify the path to the tree coordinates file. Use the provided interface to generate or delete trees in the simulation.

## Script Details

### `generate_trees(path_to_coords)`

This function reads tree coordinates from the specified file and generates trees in the simulation based on the provided information.

### `delete_forest(stage: Stage)`

This function removes all trees generated by the script from the simulation.

### `convert_rotation(roll, pitch, yaw)`

Converts rotation angles from degrees to quaternions.

### `check_raycast(stage, path_to_object)`

Projects a raycast from the tree's origin to find the ground level and adjusts the tree's position accordingly.

## Interface

The script provides a simple user interface with the following components:

- **Tree coordinate path**: Specify the path to the tree coordinates file using the provided file picker.
- **Generate trees**: Click this button to generate trees in the simulation based on the provided coordinates file.
- **Delete trees**: Click this button to delete all trees generated by the script from the simulation.

## Notes

- Ensure that the paths to tree models are correctly set before running the script.
- The script assumes that the tree models are in USD format.
- Make sure the tree coordinates file follows the specified format for successful tree placement.

Feel free to customize the script and interface according to your requirements!
